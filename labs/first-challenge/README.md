First Code Challenge
====================

This is the first challenge in your Advanced Programming Class.

1. Solution for the [Length of a Nested Array](https://edabit.com/challenge/yXSTvCNen2DQHyrh6) challenge.

Build Requirements
------------------
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) (whatever version of Python 3 should work)
- [make utility](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/make.1.html)


How to build
------------
This is not necessary since we are using Python. But if you want to compile all files for some reason use:

`make compile`


How to Run
----------
The Makefile contains directives for running and testing, open the terminal and use the following commands on this directory.

**Running the python program.**

`make run`

**Running all unitests.**

`make test`

Alternately, you can start the program by using:

`python first_challenge.py`
